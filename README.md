# Ansible Playbooks for Azure

This repository contains examples and best practices for building Ansible Playbooks for Azure. 

## Prerequisites

- Azure Account. If you don't have it, get a [free one](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/).

  To authenticate with Azure, generate [service principal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-create-service-principal-portal) and expose them as environment variables or store them as a file. 

- Install [Ansible]((http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/intro_installation.html))
- Install Azure dependencies pacakage
  ```
  pip install ansible[azure]
  ```
- Install [azure_preview_modules](https://galaxy.ansible.com/Azure/azure_preview_modules/) role.
- Install azure_preview_module role's dependencies packages.
  ```
  pip install -r ~/.ansible/roles/Azure.azure_preview_modules/files/requirements-azure.txt
  ```

## How to run
To run samples in your local environment,

- git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ansible-playbooks.git
- cd ansible-playbooks
- modify playbook to replace variables with yours, such as resource group name.
- [add Azure credential info](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/scenario_guides/guide_azure.html) either by setting environment variables or by credential files or by AZ CLI login. 
  ```
  # option 1. setting below environment variables
  AZURE_CLIENT_ID=<service_principal_client_id>
  AZURE_SECRET=<service_principal_password>
  AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=<azure_subscription_id>
  AZURE_TENANT=<azure_tenant_id>

  # option 2. add below content to file $HOME/.azure/credentials.
  [default]
  subscription_id=xxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
  client_id=xxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
  secret=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
  tenant=xxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx

  # option3. do az login firstly
  az login
  ```
- ansible-playbook sample.yml

You also could develop your Ansible playbook and run it in [Visual Sutdio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscoss.vscode-ansible).
